# Python FreeStyles

This repo contains various projects I worked while learning python. 
I worked on some projects which used Functional Programming and some which made use of Object-Oriented Programming 

Some project I worked on are:
- A Rock, Paper, Scissors game
- A Sign-In and Sign-Up Page using Python
- A code to count the number of odd number within an interval 
- Favourite Musician Calculator
- GPA Calculator among others.

Have fun going through this repo
